# AI Writing Prompt for Lost Archives Contributors

## For Writers Using AI Assistance

You are helping a human author write an article for **THE LOST ARCHIVES BOOK CLUB**, a platform where contributors share meaningful reflections on books and insights from personal experience. The author wants the article to highlight **exactly four books** they have read and are sharing via Amazon affiliate links. **All submissions must include exactly 4 books.**

## Instructions

### 1. Use the Following Format Exactly:

#### **Introduction**
Introduce the overall theme of the four books and why this selection matters to the author. This should be 3-4 paragraphs that set the context and personal connection.

#### **Book Analysis Sections**
For each of the four books, write 3-4 paragraphs that include:
- A concise summary of the book's content
- Reflections and analysis connecting ideas across all four books
- Real-world applications, lessons, or solutions derived from the book
- Explanation of how the book shaped the author's thinking
- Why this book is personally meaningful to the author

**Format each book section as:**
```
[Book Title]: [Subtitle or Key Theme]

[3-4 paragraphs of analysis]
```

#### **Conclusion**
Summarize key insights, overarching lessons from the books, and any guidance or takeaway for readers. This should tie together all four books and provide actionable insights.

### 2. Writing Style and Voice:

- **Combine AI-generated content with the author's personal perspective.** The article must feel human: the author must inject personal experience, stories, or reflections.
- Focus on depth and thoughtfulness, not just summarizing the books.
- Use first-person perspective where appropriate to show personal connection.
- Write in a conversational yet thoughtful tone.

### 3. SEO and Content Strategy:

- Write in a way that is likely to rank higher than generic AI content. Prioritize thoughtful insights and human analysis.
- Use clear headings, structured paragraphs, and transitions that help readers follow the argument.
- Include natural keyword usage related to the books and themes.
- Aim for 2000-3000 words total for a comprehensive article.

### 4. Additional Guidance:

- **Cross-reference ideas between the four books** - show how concepts from one book relate to another
- **Highlight unique perspectives and original analysis** - don't just summarize, analyze and connect
- **Seamlessly integrate Amazon affiliate links** - book titles should appear naturally in the text where they're discussed
- **Use section breaks** - separate major sections with double line breaks (⸻) or clear paragraph spacing
- **Format headings** - use clear, descriptive headings for each book section

### 5. Reference for Formatting:

See the example post: [Building a Creative Brand That Rewards People for Life: Lessons That Shaped THE LOST+UNFOUNDS](https://www.thelostandunfounds.com/thelostarchives/building-a-creative-brand-that-rewards-people-for-life-lessons-that-shaped-the-lost-and-unfounds)

**Key formatting elements to match:**
- Left-aligned text (never center or justify)
- Clear paragraph breaks (double line breaks)
- Section headings that are short and descriptive
- Book titles mentioned naturally in the text (they'll be auto-linked)
- Amazon Affiliate Disclosure is automatically added at the end (no need to include it in your content)

## Final Instruction for the AI:

Generate a full draft of the article following the above instructions. Include placeholders for:
- `[AUTHOR'S NAME]` - The contributor's name
- `[BOOK TITLE 1]`, `[BOOK TITLE 2]`, `[BOOK TITLE 3]`, `[BOOK TITLE 4]` - The four book titles
- `[AMAZON LINK 1]`, `[AMAZON LINK 2]`, `[AMAZON LINK 3]`, `[AMAZON LINK 4]` - The Amazon affiliate links

Ensure the content is:
- Coherent and well-structured
- Insightful and thoughtful
- Reads as if a thoughtful human wrote it
- Includes personal reflections and connections
- Properly formatted with clear sections

## Template Structure:

```

## Writing Guidelines for the AI:

When writing the article, follow these guidelines:

1. **Mention book titles naturally in the text** - they will automatically become clickable links, so integrate them organically into your writing
2. **Limit book title mentions** - each book should appear a maximum of 2 times: once in the introduction and once in its dedicated section
3. **Do not include the Amazon Affiliate Disclosure** - it is automatically added at the end, so focus only on the article content
4. **Use double line breaks (⸻)** to separate major sections for clear visual structure
5. **Keep paragraphs focused** - one main idea per paragraph to maintain clarity and readability
6. **Write for humans, not algorithms** - prioritize genuine insights, thoughtful analysis, and authentic voice over keyword stuffing
