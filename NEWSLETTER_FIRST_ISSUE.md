First off, thank you for checking out the site and subscribing to our mailing list. This website has been a long time coming and has gone through several integrations to get to where it is today. The goal has always been to make something clean, functional, and visually beautiful. I think I've accomplished that, and I'm excited about how it's turned out.

I designed this site in conjunction with artificial intelligence, leveraging tools like Cursor, Google A.I. Studio, ChatGPT, Claude, and others. It's been dope to see how far AI has come, and I finally feel like technology has caught up to the ideas I've held in my head and heart for a long time--while also helping me surface new ones I didn't know were possible.

My goal with this brand is to create something that makes it easier for people to generate income online and to create tools that support the creator's workflow. One of the first ways we've been able to do that is through our blog, THE LOST ARCHIVES.

At first, I was writing this blog the old-fashioned way: coming up with an idea and extracting the info from my head. I realized quickly that with all the work I still had to do, I needed help getting articles made. I also knew that plenty of sites were already using AI-generated content, so doing things the old-fashioned way might not be the best idea if we wanted to keep up.

So I asked AI how sites grow with generated content and how that content gets through all the filters to rank higher on search engines. From there, I learned that generating AI content that follows Google's E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) and keeps a human in the loop was all we needed to start producing at a higher rate.

I still had to find something to write about. They say if you have a problem, find a book to solve it. I started writing about a book and then thought, "How can I sell it?" Becoming an Amazon Affiliate was the answer I received. I completed my article, signed up for Amazon, and added links. Then I realized that if I could set this up for me, I could set it up for anyone to run. So I did just that.

If you register with our site and Amazon Affiliates, you unlock unlimited earning potential, an ever-expanding tool for content creation and publishing, and a community you can leverage to stand out on search engines. Our goal is to help you convert.

Thanks again for signing up for this newsletter. I hope to see you get set up and contributing to our blog very soon. If you want to know more about submitting articles, check out our [Getting Started Guide](https://www.thelostandunfounds.com/blog/getting-started). And if you're just here for the merch, I'm not mad at you.
