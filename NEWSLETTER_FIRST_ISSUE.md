---

Hey family,

It finally feels good to say this out loud: THE LOST+UNFOUNDS is open, humming, and ready for anyone who is tired of waiting on permission to build something of their own. We are part creative studio, part publication, part affiliate lab -- a place where R&D is not a deck, it is our daily reps. If you are here, you are the kind of person who sees a frontier, grabs a notebook, and brings back intel for the rest of us. This newsletter is your field guide. Let us talk about what is live, how to bend it into revenue, and where we are heading next.

### What you just unlocked
- **The Lost Archives.** Multiple editorial lanes (Main Blog, BookClub, GearHeads, Edge of the Borderlands, MAD SCIENTISTS, New Theory) with a built-in Human-in-the-Loop workflow so AI assists you without erasing your voice.
- **Personal subdomains.** Claim `thelostandunfounds.com/blog/yourname` in minutes and use it as the URL Amazon asks for when you onboard as an Associate.
- **Amazon storefront handshake.** Drop your Storefront ID once and we auto-thread it across articles that require affiliate links.
- **Affiliate Dashboard + payout controls.** Track clicks, conversions, MLM network data, discount credits, employee pricing, and King Midas earnings in one place.
- **King Midas leaderboard.** Eight percent of daily profit gets sliced to the top affiliates. Every day is a new race.
- **Tool Box + Sage Mode.** TikTok downloader, AI writing prompts, component sandboxes, and report exports that make content ops faster.
- **Brand assets + merch.** That means launch-ready visuals, Secret Santa campaigns, and reward badges you can hand to your people when they join in.

### Turn the platform into income (right now)
1. **Claim your lane.** Register your subdomain, lock in the URL you want on business cards, and copy it for Amazon Associates. No subdomain = no custom hub.
2. **Verify with Amazon.** Paste your new URL during Associates signup, grab your Storefront ID, and drop it back into your profile. That is how the system attributes your links.
3. **Pick a column and publish.** Use the Contributor Getting Started guide, follow the format (BookClub wants four books, GearHeads wants 1-8 products, etc.), and keep every paragraph text-left per the style guide. Your work ships faster when it meets the template.
4. **Switch on the Affiliate Dashboard.** Update your payout threshold, PayPal email, and discount code. You can even set employee pricing or issue referral credits for your own readers.
5. **Compete in King Midas.** Every sale you drive adds to the daily profit pool. Finish top three and you are splitting 8% of the entire day's profit with the rest of the podium.
6. **Automate your promo loop.** Turn clips into traffic using the TikTok Downloader, drop fresh CTAs into your subdomain, and repurpose newsletter paragraphs into blog intros.
7. **Document the build.** Sage Mode lets you snapshot components, annotate tweaks, and export reports -- instant receipts for clients, collabs, or your own portfolio.

### Income plays we are watching
- **BookClub cohorts.** Pick four books, host a weekly async discussion in your subdomain, and tie every selection to your storefront links.
- **GearHeads seasonal drops.** Publish the kits you actually run (studio rigs, trail packs, creator vans) and package them as shoppable stories.
- **Borderlands field notes.** Share travel intel plus the gear + services that made the trip possible. People want the packing list, not the postcard.
- **New Theory lab reports.** Walk readers through the systems you are building at home -- nutrition stacks, hydro setups, automation scripts -- and attach the tools you buy.
- **Affiliate tree building.** Invite two friends into the program, help them onboard, and earn from their networks through the MLM tracking tables.

### This week's action plan
- Visit `https://www.thelostandunfounds.com/home` and finish the Email Signup cameo if you have not already. We will use the list to send quick deployment alerts.
- Head to `/blog/getting-started` for the contributor checklist, style rules, and AI prompts.
- Jump into `/affiliate-dashboard` to confirm your payout profile, grab your referral link, and explore the customer tree.
- Bookmark `/king-midas` so you can see daily standings and how much money is on the line.
- Explore `/tools` and `/sagemode` to find the workflows that help you build faster (and produce better proofs for your readers or clients).

### On deck
- **More automation inside Affiliate Admin.** Bulk uploads for payouts, CSV exports, and one-click compliance packets.
- **AI-enabled submission vetting.** Faster review cycles with redact + highlight features for editors.
- **Community drops.** Shared prompts, design packs, and merch runs tied to leaderboard milestones.
- **Live SQL surface.** Every migration and blog publish script hits `thelostandunfounds.com/sql` so you can audit what changed and copy it straight into Supabase.

We are building this out in public with you. Forward this to someone who is sitting on an idea, invite your crew to grab their subdomain, and report back with what is working. Reply to this email (or drop a note in the Discord) with wins, obstacles, or requests -- we are here to help you ship.

Keep going,

**THE LOST+UNFOUNDS**
