        "title": "Building a Creative Brand That Rewards People for Life: Lessons That Shaped THE LOST+UNFOUNDS",
        "content": "THE LOST+UNFOUNDS began as an idea to create a creative brand, a platform where contributions matter and people can grow alongside the vision. Books like The E-Myth Revisited, Contagious, This Is Not a T-Shirt, and The Alchemist offered lessons about leadership, influence, and purpose that shaped how I approached building the brand.\n\nThese insights helped clarify how to value contributors, nurture culture, and create frameworks that support long-term engagement and growth.\n\nBy integrating these ideas, THE LOST+UNFOUNDS became a creative brand that prioritizes meaningful contributions, encourages collaboration, and embraces innovation.\n\nAmazon Affiliate Disclosure: As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases.

This helps support THE LOST+UNFOUNDS and allows us to continue creating content. Thank you for your support!\n\nEarly Inspiration and Learning\nIn the early days of imagining THE LOST+UNFOUNDS, my inspiration came from many directions-pop culture, art, music, entrepreneurship, and the people who blend these disciplines in creative ways. Stories of multifaceted innovators and boundary-pushing artists fueled my curiosity and desire to build a brand that could evolve, adapt, and explore new opportunities.\n\nThe idea for THE LOST+UNFOUNDS existed before I discovered these books, but reading The E-Myth Revisited, Contagious, This Is Not a T-Shirt, and The Alchemist helped refine my understanding of business, community, and long-term brand building. They reminded me of the importance of scalability, influence, and a deeper sense of purpose.\n\nThese books provided structural guidance and reinforced the principles I already believed in-that a brand should be a platform for growth and contribution. This foundation allows THE LOST+UNFOUNDS to continue its mission of rewarding meaningful engagement for life.\n\nThe E-Myth Revisited by Michael E. Gerber: Building a Business That Can Grow\nThe E-Myth Revisited taught me to view THE LOST+UNFOUNDS as a system, not just a series of individual tasks. Gerber highlights that many creative people fail because they focus on doing the work rather than building the business. This helped me prioritize creating a scalable framework that allows the brand to grow and evolve without losing its core vision.\n\nI realized that if I wanted THE LOST+UNFOUNDS to truly reward people for life, I needed to build a structure that could support they wide-ranging contributions of artists, writers, and thinkers. Gerber's lessons on systematization and delegation were essential in designing a brand that is built to last.\n\nContagious by Jonah Berger: Understanding Influence and Word of Mouth\nContagious provided insights into why certain ideas spread and how to build a brand that resonates with people. Berger's framework of social currency, triggers, emotion, public visibility, practical value, and stories helped me think about how THE LOST+UNFOUNDS could become a brand that people naturally want to share and contribute to.\n\nUnderstanding the mechanics of influence allowed me to focus on creating content and experiences that provide real value and spark conversation. This, in turn, helps build a community where everyone's contributions can gain traction and have a lasting impact.\n\nThis Is Not a T-Shirt by Bobby Hundreds: Nurturing a Community and Culture\nIn This Is Not a T-Shirt, Bobby Hundreds shares his journey building a brand rooted in community and culture. His story reminded me that a successful brand is about more than just a product-it's about the people who believe in it and the relationships that are formed through it.\n\nThis resonated deeply with my goal for THE LOST+UNFOUNDS. Hundreds' focus on authenticity and community-building helped me realize that our brand's strength lies in its ability to bring people together around shared values and creative pursuits. This culture is what makes our contribution-based rewards so meaningful.\n\nThe Alchemist by Paulo Coelho: Embracing the Journey and Following Your Legend\nThe Alchemist is a story about finding one's purpose and having the courage to follow it. While not a business book, its themes of persistence, intuition, and following one's \"Personal Legend\" provided profound inspiration for the overarching mission of THE LOST+UNFOUNDS.\n\nI want our brand to be a space where people feel empowered to pursue their own creative legends. Coelho's story reminded me that the most rewarding ventures are those that are driven by a deeper sense of meaning and a commitment to one's journey. This philosophy is at the heart of everything we do.\n\nCreating a Framework for Life\nBy integrating these diverse lessons, THE LOST+UNFOUNDS is more than just a brand; it's a dynamic platform designed to foster growth and reward contributions over the long term. We've built a structure that values community, understands influence, and honors the creative journey.\n\nWe invite you to join us on this path. Whether you're contributing your art, sharing your ideas, or simply being part of our community, your engagement matters. Together, we are building something that rewards people for life.\n\nConclusion\nTHE LOST+UNFOUNDS is a testament to the power of integrating diverse perspectives-from business systems and social science to community culture and philosophical narratives. These lessons have helped us create a brand that is both scalable and deeply resonant.\n\nAs we continue to grow, our focus remains on nurturing a culture where every contribution contributes to a larger, shared vision. We are excited for the journey ahead and the opportunity to build a creative brand that truly makes a difference. Maktub.",

        "content": "In this life, I have experienced a whole lot of change. In change, I have learned of the impermanence of the world and my resolve to keep going, regardless of the circumstances. What is it that keeps me from giving up my light and surrendering to doubt?\n\nOne of the hardest things for me to hide in my lifetime is my heart dwelling on my sleeve. I've always been someone to stand up or speak up for myself, the people I care about, and even strangers. More often than not, it has lead to some significant moments in my life where, change had to occur. \n\nI haven't lived at one address for more than three years, since I was in high school. For more than half my life, stability has been an issue. I haven't had a place to call home in over three years, and after losing my apartment in April of 2022, \"home\", has become an abstract thought to me. \n\nI have mostly lived in my car during this time, occasionally staying with friends or family, but I have been unable to find the stability I need to get back within my own four walls. I am blessed to at least be able to have a car and a semi-safe place to sleep, but I will never accept that this is all there is for me. I will have the home I imagine in my head someday. \n\nThis is the faith that I hold on to.\n\nNow, before you ask if I have worked anywhere during this span (the answer is yes), please understand that I have decided that I am un-hirable. Don't get me wrong, I love to work and I have had some jobs I loved that I had to leave for one reason or another, but at 40 years old, being under someone's employ is a deal-breaker for me.\n\nWhy? Because I am an unofficial agent of change. I recognize inconsistencies in the management of these companies, blatant hypocrisies, and I almost never hesitate to speak up about it. It's like leaving a toddler in a room with a plate of cookies. \n\nThough the saying \"work smarter not harder\" is commonplace, sadly that doesn't always connect with some people, and that frustrates me. People cut dangerous corners in the workplace, and I'm a Wendy's kind of guy. I love those square burgers! \n\nFunny enough, I know and accept that perhaps I was the one that hasn't been working smarter this whole time, but I was lead to keep making the same mistakes because I caved to the societal pressures I always believed did not apply to me. I had to stop being what everyone else wanted me to be and do what was right for myself.\n\nAs soon as I started doing that, the dots started to connect. The inner work started inner working and the outer experience started to improve. I still have trouble reaching an understanding with people, but I am comfortable enough with myself to not let it shake my confidence.\n\nI am resilient and resourceful, and I have a vision that has not changed throughout this time. To run this website, help people, and build a brand that changes the way people do business. In short, I want to build the best \"job\" on the planet. We'll see how that goes.",

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence: The Job Killer",
        "content": "The inspiration for this post comes from watching an interview featuring Earnest Hausman, a current member of the University of Michigan Wolverines football team. Hausman was born in Uganda and adopted as a child, and just recently returned to Uganda for the first time since he left. \n\nEarnest visited his village for the first time since he was a child and discovered that they did not have access to clean drinking water. He came back on a second trip with a plan to drill a well for his family and village to use. As I am watching this video of this giant truck drilling in the middle of this village, a stark contrast of technological progress was evident. I don't know how they were getting water before, but I believe a lot of resources and energy were devoted to getting water to sustain this village. \n\nSo, I'm watching this interview unfold and they are standing at the pump and you can see the containers to gather the water as one is being filled. You see the spirits of all of these people being lifted. My immediate thought was, \"Think, of all the work, they don't have to do to get water anymore\". They can literally spend their time doing other things to make their village better now. This is the power of technology.\n\nHere, in the U.S. and around the world, artificial intelligence is in full swing. We've reached a point where companies looking to save money on labor are opting to use A.I. and the jobs market is headed towards peak demand. \n\nWill A.I. take our jobs? \n\nI say, \"Yes, but only if you let it.\"\n\nThroughout history, across the U.S., and many other countries and many other periods through the development of the human race, there has always been a cycle of new technology changing the workforce and ending traditional jobs. Whether it's the lightbulb ending the demand for professional candle makers, or the automobile ending the stable industry, the underlying factor that remains consistent is that there are new jobs and possibilities that the new tools create. \n\nThink about the well in Uganda. What did the people do before the well was drilled? Who got the water and carried it back to the village? Those were jobs. They were essential to the life of the village, and now those people may find themselves in search of a new thing. \n\nBut think about the possibilities. With the time and energy saved, the village can redirect into education, small businesses, and building stronger infrastructure like schools and clinics. As that change compounds over time, even greater tools are unlocked, and those tools create more tools and so on. \n\nThe villagers may be unemployed as water collectors and carriers, but more work needs to be done. This brings me to the purpose of writing this article. A.I. will, and already has, taken many jobs, but it has opened up so many more possibilities for other jobs that didn't exist before. It makes it easier for people to build better tools and frees us up for the opportunity to learn more. I've heard people say that A.I. making us dumber, but I strongly disagree with the logic of this argument. I believe that it's making us smarter in different areas of life.\n\nWhen you point to students using A.I. to write a paper, and say they aren't learning, to me, that's like telling those villagers to go get water the same way they did before. Do you not see the well in the center of the village? This is why the education system has failed us. In the real world, those students will go on to work for a living, and the only thing that will matter is the outcome. No business owner is going to ban their employees from using A.I., if it's bringing in more money. It's not cheating to use A.I., it's reality. In the real world, if that village doesn't use the well, that village would struggle with the same issues as before. Stop sending students in search of water when the information is right there. Think about how to incorporate it into learning instead of banning it and consider the infinite possibilities and jobs that artificial intelligence can create. You got this!",

        "title": "Cursor IDE: A match made in heaven -until I run out of A.I. credits.",
        "content": "Ok, so here we are with my first bit of intel from the field, but it's a big piece of the puzzle. So, the site that you are checking out today was developed using an Integrated Development Environment or IDE, called Cursor, to help me develop most of what you see. \n\nThough we have a minimal design aesthetic, there's a lot of bells and whistles that go on behind the scenes to make it all work. Now, I am no coder, but over time I have learned enough lingo and enough about what I want to build to know what to ask LLMs to make for me.\n\nAnd if I don't know?\n\nWell, then I have A.I. construct a prompt from my thoughts and then I clarify the details along the way until my idea is formed into deliberate, concise instructions I can pass along to my agents in Cursor. \n\nMy favorite things about Cursor:\n\n1. MCP servers - Model Context Protocol or MCP is a way for A.I. models to carry out tasks on external tools. So, you can give it access to your front-end on Vercel and connect your GitHub repository and make live edits on your site when you commit to the main branch. Or connect to your Google Drive and create new folders or reorganize your files. This is a game changer because there are thousands of MCP servers out there already and the automations are really huge time savers.\n\n2. Agent-Browser capabilities- In Cursor 2.0, they introduced the ability for the A.I. agents to use the browser to help you check for errors or select multiple divs (containers for grouping HTML elements) to reference in the chat. Or you can try to talk your way through it, which can be problematic if you don't know the proper names of things. The browser eliminates the middleman and reduces the hallucinations and saves tokens for better reasoning and higher performance. \n\n3. Reasoning models- Cursor gives you plenty of choices when it comes to the model that you want to use for your specific needs. From high speed and low tokens to really smart and thorough. It supports LLMs like gpt-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and more. \n\nOverall, Cursor is definitely high-end software. I would call it the triple-A title of IDEs. At the end of the day, it's just a tool, but it's a tool that lets me build things that I couldn't before. It makes me a faster and better developer and allows me to focus on the things that I'm good at, like thinking about the big picture and the vision of the site. \n\nWait, I almost missed my favorite feature about Cursor, which is probably the most used feature as well: Compos- Mode. In Compose, you can just type out a general request for a new feature or a fix and Cursor will go and find every file that needs to be updated and suggest the changes for you. This allows you to build out features incredibly fast. When combined with the reasoning of the newest models, it is very powerful. \n\nCode = word zombies. \n\nCursor mows down lines of code, and it's only going to get better at doing it. As a vibe-coder, it is my IDE of choice because I can do the vibe coding, but actually connect it to my repository, tools, and services. We will see how far it will take me. I've used Figma, Make, Google A.I. Studio, and Co-Pilot, but none of them ever got me this far. Google just dropped Anti-Gravity, which I may give a shot, but right now, I just want to keep building with Cursor until I can roll out my first next key feature for this site. \n\nIf Cursor never changed over 10 years, and it was the only A.I. tool you used every day, then you will probably own 10 multi-million dollar projects. It may run you about $200-500/m depending on what you're doing, but let's do the math for an education, shall we? \n\n$24,000 for four years. That's not a bad education. Especially, especially if you're building to be profitable. And there's so much opportunity out there to make that $24K back before you graduate. $500 a month is worth setting up a system that can receive money for you over time. And if you convert that into Bitcoin? Well, we'll get into that in the next bit.\n\nBut here's the thing: In reality, it's not going to stay the same for 10 years. A.I. will get better, smarter, and cheaper. Vibe coding is to coding, as Serato control records is to vinyl DJs. That last connection between seeing and reading the code to just tapping that sync button and letting the transition ride out is upon us. If you hop in now, you might still remember the old way, which will help you be the best translator for the new way to all the late comers who pick up the shovels after all the digging has been done.",

        "content": "<p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\">At <strong class=\"font-bold text-white\">THE LOST+UNFOUNDS</strong>, the way we build reflects creativity, autonomy, and flexibility. Every tool we use has a purpose: keeping us organized, helping us experiment, and letting us stay in flow. Over time, our stack has become a core part of how we bring our ideas to life.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-white/20\" /><h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-8 text-left first:mt-0\">Front-End Tools</h2><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\">The front-end is everything a user sees and interacts with on a website or app - essentially, the \"face\" of your platform. It includes layouts, buttons, forms, images, text, animations, and other interactive elements. Front-end tools determine how the website looks, how users navigate it, and how they interact with it.</p><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\">Front-end development uses languages and frameworks like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which instruct the browser on how to display and respond to content.</p><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\"><strong class=\"font-bold text-white\">Vercel: Deploying and Testing the Website</strong><br /><a href=\"https://vercel.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition font-bold\">Vercel</a> makes it easy to deploy websites and preview changes in real time. When we update code, it automatically builds a live version so we can test features immediately and share them for feedback. If we adjust the layout of the marketplace or a blog page, Vercel lets us see the changes instantly. It handles performance, caching, and scaling behind the scenes, letting us focus on design and experimentation.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-white/20\" /><h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-8 text-left first:mt-0\">Back-End Tools</h2><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\">The back-end is everything happening behind the scenes to make a website or app function. While the front-end is what users see, the back-end is like the engine under the hood that processes data, runs logic, and ensures everything works correctly.</p><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\">Back-end responsibilities include servers, databases, APIs, and application logic. These components manage the flow of data between systems, handle requests from the front-end, and enforce rules for how the platform operates. Back-end development uses languages and frameworks like Python, Node.js, Supabase, and server frameworks to run these processes efficiently.</p><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\"><strong class=\"font-bold text-white\">GitHub: Tracking and Organizing Code</strong><br /><a href=\"https://github.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition font-bold\">GitHub</a> stores all our code and tracks every change we make. It allows us to experiment safely using branches and revert changes if something doesn''t work. For instance, if we want to try a new marketplace feature or a blog layout adjustment, we can create a branch, test it, and merge it once it works. GitHub also helps document the project, keeping the code organized and easier to maintain.</p><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\"><strong class=\"font-bold text-white\">MCP Servers: Connecting AI to Tools and Data</strong><br /><a href=\"https://modelcontextprotocol.io\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition font-bold\">MCP (Model Context Protocol)</a> servers let AI tools safely access external services and data. They act as bridges that allow AI to read and write data, trigger actions, and interact with APIs while following rules and permissions. For example, AI could pull data from Supabase, update front-end components in Vercel, or interact with payment services like Stripe. MCP servers make AI-assisted workflows scalable and allow automation without building custom integrations for every tool individually.</p><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\"><strong class=\"font-bold text-white\">Railway: Running Servers Without Hassle</strong><br /><a href=\"https://railway.app\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition font-bold\">Railway</a> simplifies server deployment and management by handling networking, scaling, and infrastructure automatically. We can spin up new backend services for experiments or user requests quickly without configuring servers manually.</p><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\"><strong class=\"font-bold text-white\">Supabase: Managing Data and Authentication</strong><br /><a href=\"https://supabase.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition font-bold\">Supabase</a> provides database management, user authentication, and storage. It lets us track user accounts, store marketplace content, and manage subscriptions efficiently. Its integration with our stack ensures reliability while allowing experimentation and iteration.</p><hr class=\"my-8 border-white/20\" /><h2 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-8 text-left first:mt-0\">Development & Supporting Tools</h2><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\">These tools help us build, prototype, and integrate systems smoothly, from coding environments to AI assistants to payment infrastructure.</p><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\"><strong class=\"font-bold text-white\">Cursor: Writing, Refining, and Prototyping Code</strong><br /><a href=\"https://cursor.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition font-bold\">Cursor</a> helps us structure code, prototype new features, and experiment efficiently. It keeps our code organized and lets us iterate quickly. We can test a new layout for the marketplace, refine subscription workflows, or experiment with AI-assisted content generation. Cursor keeps the process flowing and helps maintain clarity while building.</p><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\"><strong class=\"font-bold text-white\">Antigravity: Powerful Agentic AI Coding Assistant</strong><br /><strong class=\"font-bold text-white\">Antigravity</strong> is a powerful agentic AI coding assistant designed by the <strong class=\"font-bold text-white\">Google Deepmind</strong> team working on Advanced Agentic Coding. As we begin to use Antigravity for building and maintaining this site, it provides us with an unprecedented level of autonomy and creative speed. It doesn''t just suggest code; it helps us navigate the entire architecture, solve complex bugs, and implement new features with high-level reasoning. This is a core part of our movement towards an autonomous, AI-empowered development workflow.</p><p class=\"mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left\"><strong class=\"font-bold text-white\">AI Tools — Google AI Studio, ChatGPT, and Claude</strong><br />AI tools assist with reasoning, content generation, and organization. <a href=\"https://aistudio.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition font-bold\">Google AI Studio</a> allows us to test ideas rapidly. <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition font-bold\">ChatGPT</a> helps structure outputs and solve problems efficiently. <a href=\"https://claude.ai\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition font-bold\">Claude</a> clarifies concepts and organizes ideas so they can be implemented effectively.

        "title": "The Leaders Who Walked With Me: How Four Childhood Books Shaped My Military Life",
        "content": "Leadership is often described in tidy definitions and laminated cards: loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, personal courage. But no one becomes a leader because they memorized an acronym. Leadership comes from stories - the ones you grow up with, the ones you cling to during the hardest seasons, and the ones you discover about yourself along the way.\n\nBefore I ever stood in formation, before deployment orders, before helicopters and sandstorms and long nights of wondering who I would become, there were books. Four stories in particular: The Hobbit, Ender’s Game, The Hunger Games, and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I didn’t know it at the time, but these characters - Bilbo, Ender, Katniss, and Edmund - would become mentors, mirrors, and warnings as I navigated my own journey into service, war, and adulthood.\n\nEach book arrived in my life exactly when I needed it. And each character taught me a different face of leadership.\n\nBilbo Baggins: Courage Is Doing It Anyway\n\nI read The Hobbit right after I got my deployment orders to Afghanistan. There’s a special kind of shock when someone knocks on the door of your comfortable life and tells you your plans are over. That you need to pack your things. That adventure - or violence, or uncertainty - is now mandatory.\n\nGandalf or Uncle Sam, who really cares? Both show up uninvited. Both tell you, “Let’s go.”\n\nWhat I love about Bilbo is that he is not a warrior. Not a chosen one. Not a knight of the round table. He’s a reluctant fool with every excuse to decline. But the only way out is through. He taught me that courage isn’t the absence of fear or the presence of a sword; it’s the decision to leave the door open even when you’d rather lock it.\n\nIn the military, we talk about “embrace the suck.” Bilbo taught me how to do that with a sense of humor and a steady hand.\n\nEnder Wiggin: Empathy Is the Ultimate Tactical Advantage\n\nEnder’s Game is often read as a book about strategy, but I found it to be a book about the burden of command. Ender is a child forced to grow up in a system that wants his brilliance but doesn’t care about his soul. He’s isolated, manipulated, and pushed to the edge.\n\nBut his greatest strength isn’t his ability to win; it’s his ability to understand. To defeat an enemy, he first has to love them. He has to see the world through their eyes.\n\nIn uniform, it’s easy to dehumanize the mission. It’s easy to see people as data points or objectives. Ender reminded me that a leader who loses their empathy loses their humanity. He taught me that the most powerful thing you can bring to a conflict is the willingness to see the person on the other side of the line.\n\nKatniss Everdeen: Balance Is the Key to Survival\n\nKatniss Everdeen is a leader born of necessity. She doesn’t want the spotlight. She doesn’t want the responsibility. She just wants to protect the people she loves. She’s a survivor, a huntress, and a symbol of defiance.\n\nWhat Katniss taught me is the importance of balance. In the military, you are often pushed to the extreme - physically, mentally, and emotionally. You are expected to be everything to everyone at all times. But Katniss showed me that a leader who doesn’t find balance will eventually break.\n\nYou have to know when to fight and when to rest. When to speak and when to listen. When to lead and when to follow. Katniss taught me that survival is not just about staying alive; it’s about keeping your spirit intact.\n\nEdmund Pevensie: Redemption Is Always Possible\n\nIn The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Edmund is the traitor. He’s the one who sells out his siblings for a taste of Turkish Delight. He’s the one who falls for the promises of the White Witch. He’s the one who needs to be rescued.\n\nEdmund’s story is a reminder that no one is beyond redemption. We all make mistakes. We all fail. We all have moments where we are tempted by the easy path, by the promises that promise comfort but deliver isolation.\n\nHis betrayal wasn’t stupidity. It was desperation.\n\nAnd so was mine.\n\nBut Edmund’s redemption - and mine - only began when he let the façade drop. When he stopped pretending he was fine. When he surrendered the ego of who he thought he was supposed to be.\n\nWithin every soldier there’s a lionheart waiting to thaw the winter.\n\nWhat These Characters Taught Me About Leadership\n\nEach of these characters carried a different part of the leadership equation - parts the military can teach but can’t fully explain.\n\nBilbo taught me courage.\nEnder taught me empathy.\nKatniss taught me balance.\nEdmund taught me renewal.\n\nTogether they shaped my understanding of leadership as something more than rank or authority. Leadership is not perfection, certainty, or fearlessness. It’s a journey through discomfort, responsibility, sacrifice, and growth. It’s showing up for others even when you’re barely holding yourself together. It’s learning from stories - especially your own.\n\nThese books didn’t just entertain me.\nThey prepared me.\nThey steadied me.\nThey reminded me who I was in the moments when it mattered most.\n\nAnd in their pages, I learned the truth every leader eventually discovers:\n\nWe become who we are by the adventures we accept, the battles we fight, and the hearts we allow to change us.",

It doesn’t have a dozen confusing modes—it just provides powerful, clear light right when you need it. It’s the kind of tool that gives him a tactical advantage in everyday situations.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Rite in the Rain Notebook + Fisher Space Pen: Documentation for Any Environment</h3><p>Ideas don’t always wait for a dry desk.

Whether he’s at a job site, in the woods, or just running errands in the rain, this pair keeps his thoughts organized and his plans moving forward.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Putting It All Together</h3><p>Imagine Dad heading out for errands, a coffee, or a weekend project.

        "title": "To Maine, Back—and Back Again",
        "content": "<h3>The Journey</h3><p>The first time Maine found me this summer, I was sitting on a plastic chair in an Austin laundromat, watching my clothes tumble in a dryer that sounded like it was eating itself. My phone rang, and on the other end was Jake Martin—a lobster fisherman from Maine, a man I’d deployed with to Afghanistan in 2012. Back then, he was younger, goofier, and full of fishing stories. We smoked cigars in the down time, trading war silence for boat talk. In the summer of 2025, he called out of the blue and invited me on a Wounded Warrior Project canoe-camping trip. Just like that, Maine was back on the horizon.</p><p>Jake flew me out and picked me up from the airport in a company van, which shouldn’t have meant much—but it did. I felt proud riding shotgun again, like I belonged somewhere specific for a few days. The flight wasn’t free, though. Before we ever touched water, I helped him pack canoes, load a trailer, organize food, and inventory gear for a four-day river expedition. Jake supplied the essentials—tents, backpacks, paddles, canoes. I showed up light and grateful, already realizing the things I should have brought.</p><p>The river gave us everything: quiet stretches, sudden rapids, and a steady population of hand-sized fish that haunted the water just below the surface. The guys who brought fishing poles traded paddles for quick casts whenever the current slowed. More often than not, they reeled something in. It made for the perfect cigarette-break ritual—float, cast, smoke, laugh. Rapids came eventually, and with them the inevitable swims. Everyone got their turn testing their life raft and saying a small prayer for their gear. I watched the river take a pair of sunglasses and a sense of dignity, but it gave back a kind of exhaustion that felt like an old friend.</p><p>When the trip ended, I didn’t just go home. I stayed for another week. I helped Jake with his lobstering business, learned how to haul traps, and spent long days in the sun. Maine has a way of slowing you down, of making you appreciate the work and the silence. It was a week of remembering who I used to be and figuring out who I’m becoming now.</p><h3> </h3><h3>The Second Trip</h3><p>A few weeks later, Maine called again. This time it was a different kind of trip—a solo journey to clear my head and see the parts of the state I’d missed. I drove up the coast, stopping at small towns and staying in places that smelled like salt and pine. I hiked trails that felt like they hadn’t been walked in years and sat on rocky shores watching the tide go out. It was a week of solitude and reflection, a way to process the change I’ve been feeling.</p><p>I realized that Maine isn’t just a place; it’s a state of mind. It’s a reminder that sometimes you have to leave everything behind to find what matters. It’s a place that rewards preparation but also demands presence. I went to Maine twice this summer. I came back different both times.</p><p>I also learned about the gear that actually matters. The stuff that survives the river and the road. I saw how much I depended on the tools I brought—and how much I missed the ones I forgot. I watched my phone die in a rapid and realized how much I’d been using it as a shield. I saw how much I was burning through physically—and why I slept like the dead.</p><p>What I Didn’t Bring (And Should Have): Fishing Pole & Waterproof Phone Bag</p><p>This trip made one thing painfully clear: if you’re on a river in Maine, bring a fishing pole. Watching fish hit lures while your hands are stuck on a paddle is its own kind of torture.</p><p>And the waterproof phone bag? Non-negotiable. Rapids don’t care about your photos, contacts, or sense of optimism. I got lucky once. I won’t press it again.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Lessons from the Edge</h3><p>Not all journeys announce themselves as important when they start. Some begin in laundromats, phone calls, or half-serious road trip ideas. Maine reminded me that preparation matters—but so does showing up when invited. I didn’t bring everything I needed, but I brought myself, and sometimes that’s enough to be welcomed into the work.</p><p>I also learned that purpose doesn’t disappear when the uniform comes off. It just changes shape. Canoes replace convoys. Fire pits replace guard towers. The bond is still there if you’re willing to sit with it.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>If you get the call—take it. Pack better than I did, bring a fishing pole, and waterproof your phone. Say yes to the hard drives, the long roads, and the inherited gear that finds its way into your hands. Maine gave me exhaustion, laughter, old ghosts, and new pride.</p><p>I went to Maine twice this summer. I came back different both times.</p>",
