# Frontend Style Guide & Design Rules

## CRITICAL RULES
1. **NO BORDERS**: 
   - Never use visible borders on cards, containers, or images unless explicitly requested for a specific functional reason (e.g. debugging).
   - Use padding, spacing, or background color differences to separate elements.
   - **bento-cards**, **gallery items**, and **widgets** must be borderless.

## Colors
- **Black & White**: Prefer pure black (`bg-black`) and white (`text-white`) for high contrast elements like metadata cards, avoiding `zinc` or gray backgrounds for strictly black/white requested areas.

## Typography
- Use `uppercase`, `tracking-widest`, and bold fonts for labels and headers to maintain the premium aesthetic.
