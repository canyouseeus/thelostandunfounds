In the early days of imagining <strong class="font-bold text-white">THE LOST+UNFOUNDS</strong>, my inspiration came from many directions-pop culture, art, music, entrepreneurship, and the people who blend these disciplines in creative ways. Stories of multifaceted innovators and boundary-pushing artists fueled my curiosity and desire to build a brand that could evolve, adapt, and explore new opportunities.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">The idea for <strong class="font-bold text-white">THE LOST+UNFOUNDS</strong> existed before I discovered these books, but reading <a href="https://amzn.to/4fWnIDi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition">The E-Myth Revisited</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3B4O89o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition">Contagious</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3Z2f24x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition">This Is Not a T-Shirt</a>, and <a href="https://amzn.to/3ODzS6B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition">The Alchemist</a> helped refine my understanding of business, community, and long-term brand building. They reminded me of the importance of scalability, influence, and a deeper sense of purpose.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">These books provided structural guidance and reinforced the principles I already believed in-that a brand should be a platform for growth and contribution. This foundation allows <strong class="font-bold text-white">THE LOST+UNFOUNDS</strong> to continue its mission of rewarding meaningful engagement for life.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">The E-Myth Revisited by Michael E. Gerber: Building a Business That Can Grow
The E-Myth Revisited taught me to view <strong class="font-bold text-white">THE LOST+UNFOUNDS</strong> as a system, not just a series of individual tasks. Gerber highlights that many creative people fail because they focus on doing the work rather than building the business. This helped me prioritize creating a scalable framework that allows the brand to grow and evolve without losing its core vision.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">I realized that if I wanted <strong class="font-bold text-white">THE LOST+UNFOUNDS</strong> to truly reward people for life, I needed to build a structure that could support they wide-ranging contributions of artists, writers, and thinkers. Gerber''s lessons on systematization and delegation were essential in designing a brand that is built to last.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Contagious by Jonah Berger: Understanding Influence and Word of Mouth
Contagious provided insights into why certain ideas spread and how to build a brand that resonates with people. Berger''s framework of social currency, triggers, emotion, public visibility, practical value, and stories helped me think about how <strong class="font-bold text-white">THE LOST+UNFOUNDS</strong> could become a brand that people naturally want to share and contribute to.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Understanding the mechanics of influence allowed me to focus on creating content and experiences that provide real value and spark conversation. This, in turn, helps build a community where everyone''s contributions can gain traction and have a lasting impact.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">This Is Not a T-Shirt by Bobby Hundreds: Nurturing a Community and Culture
In This Is Not a T-Shirt, Bobby Hundreds shares his journey building a brand rooted in community and culture. His story reminded me that a successful brand is about more than just a product-it''s about the people who believe in it and the relationships that are formed through it.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">This resonated deeply with my goal for <strong class="font-bold text-white">THE LOST+UNFOUNDS</strong>. Hundreds'' focus on authenticity and community-building helped me realize that our brand''s strength lies in its ability to bring people together around shared values and creative pursuits. This culture is what makes our contribution-based rewards so meaningful.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho: Embracing the Journey and Following Your Legend
The Alchemist is a story about finding one''s purpose and having the courage to follow it.

UPDATE blog_posts SET content = '<p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">In this life, I have experienced a whole lot of change. In change, I have learned of the impermanence of the world and my resolve to keep going, regardless of the circumstances. What is it that keeps me from giving up my light and surrendering to doubt?</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">One of the hardest things for me to hide in my lifetime is my heart dwelling on my sleeve. I''ve always been someone to stand up or speak up for myself, the people I care about, and even strangers. More often than not, it has lead to some significant moments in my life where, change had to occur.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">I haven''t lived at one address for more than three years, since I was in high school. For more than half my life, stability has been an issue. I haven''t had a place to call home in over three years, and after losing my apartment in April of 2022, "home", has become an abstract thought to me.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">I have mostly lived in my car during this time, occasionally staying with friends or family, but I have been unable to find the stability I need to get back within my own four walls. I am blessed to at least be able to have a car and a semi-safe place to sleep, but I will never accept that this is all there is for me. I will have the home I imagine in my head someday.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">This is the faith that I hold on to.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Now, before you ask if I have worked anywhere during this span (the answer is yes), please understand that I have decided that I am un-hirable. Don''t get me wrong, I love to work and I have had some jobs I loved that I had to leave for one reason or another, but at 40 years old, being under someone''s employ is a deal-breaker for me.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Why? Because I am an unofficial agent of change. I recognize inconsistencies in the management of these companies, blatant hypocrisies, and I almost never hesitate to speak up about it. It''s like leaving a toddler in a room with a plate of cookies.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Though the saying "work smarter not harder" is commonplace, sadly that doesn''t always connect with some people, and that frustrates me. People cut dangerous corners in the workplace, and I''m a Wendy''s kind of guy. I love those square burgers!</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Funny enough, I know and accept that perhaps I was the one that hasn''t been working smarter this whole time, but I was lead to keep making the same mistakes because I caved to the societal pressures I always believed did not apply to me. I had to stop being what everyone else wanted me to be and do what was right for myself.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">As soon as I started doing that, the dots started to connect. The inner work started inner working and the outer experience started to improve. I still have trouble reaching an understanding with people, but I am comfortable enough with myself to not let it shake my confidence.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">I am resilient and resourceful, and I have a vision that has not changed throughout this time. To run this website, help people, and build a brand that changes the way people do business. In short, I want to build the best "job" on the planet. We''ll see how that goes.</p>' WHERE id = 'f5126ba2-7b6f-437c-8350-9177de53fd45';
UPDATE blog_posts SET content = '<p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">The inspiration for this post comes from watching an interview featuring Earnest Hausman, a current member of the University of Michigan Wolverines football team. Hausman was born in Uganda and adopted as a child, and just recently returned to Uganda for the first time since he left.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Earnest visited his village for the first time since he was a child and discovered that they did not have access to clean drinking water. He came back on a second trip with a plan to drill a well for his family and village to use. As I am watching this video of this giant truck drilling in the middle of this village, a stark contrast of technological progress was evident. I don''t know how they were getting water before, but I believe a lot of resources and energy were devoted to getting water to sustain this village.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">So, I''m watching this interview unfold and they are standing at the pump and you can see the containers to gather the water as one is being filled. You see the spirits of all of these people being lifted. My immediate thought was, "Think, of all the work, they don''t have to do to get water anymore". They can literally spend their time doing other things to make their village better now. This is the power of technology.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Here, in the U.S. and around the world, artificial intelligence is in full swing. We''ve reached a point where companies looking to save money on labor are opting to use A.I. and the jobs market is headed towards peak demand.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Will A.I. take our jobs?</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">I say, "Yes, but only if you let it."</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Throughout history, across the U.S., and many other countries and many other periods through the development of the human race, there has always been a cycle of new technology changing the workforce and ending traditional jobs. Whether it''s the lightbulb ending the demand for professional candle makers, or the automobile ending the stable industry, the underlying factor that remains consistent is that there are new jobs and possibilities that the new tools create.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Think about the well in Uganda. What did the people do before the well was drilled? Who got the water and carried it back to the village? Those were jobs. They were essential to the life of the village, and now those people may find themselves in search of a new thing.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">But think about the possibilities. With the time and energy saved, the village can redirect into education, small businesses, and building stronger infrastructure like schools and clinics. As that change compounds over time, even greater tools are unlocked, and those tools create more tools and so on.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">The villagers may be unemployed as water collectors and carriers, but more work needs to be done. This brings me to the purpose of writing this article. A.I. will, and already has, taken many jobs, but it has opened up so many more possibilities for other jobs that didn''t exist before. It makes it easier for people to build better tools and frees us up for the opportunity to learn more. I''ve heard people say that A.I. making us dumber, but I strongly disagree with the logic of this argument. I believe that it''s making us smarter in different areas of life.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">When you point to students using A.I. to write a paper, and say they aren''t learning, to me, that''s like telling those villagers to go get water the same way they did before. Do you not see the well in the center of the village? This is why the education system has failed us. In the real world, those students will go on to work for a living, and the only thing that will matter is the outcome. No business owner is going to ban their employees from using A.I., if it''s bringing in more money. It''s not cheating to use A.I., it''s reality. In the real world, if that village doesn''t use the well, that village would struggle with the same issues as before. Stop sending students in search of water when the information is right there. Think about how to incorporate it into learning instead of banning it and consider the infinite possibilities and jobs that artificial intelligence can create. You got this!</p>' WHERE id = 'f1eaae3a-f957-43a1-b709-23511b2edded';

UPDATE blog_posts SET content = '<p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Ok, so here we are with my first bit of intel from the field, but it''s a big piece of the puzzle. So, the site that you are checking out today was developed using an Integrated Development Environment or IDE, called Cursor, to help me develop most of what you see.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Though we have a minimal design aesthetic, there''s a lot of bells and whistles that go on behind the scenes to make it all work. Now, I am no coder, but over time I have learned enough lingo and enough about what I want to build to know what to ask LLMs to make for me.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">And if I don''t know?</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Well, then I have A.I. construct a prompt from my thoughts and then I clarify the details along the way until my idea is formed into deliberate, concise instructions I can pass along to my agents in Cursor.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">My favorite things about Cursor:</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">1. MCP servers - Model Context Protocol or MCP is a way for A.I. models to carry out tasks on external tools. So, you can give it access to your front-end on Vercel and connect your GitHub repository and make live edits on your site when you commit to the main branch. Or connect to your Google Drive and create new folders or reorganize your files. This is a game changer because there are thousands of MCP servers out there already and the automations are really huge time savers.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">2. Agent-Browser capabilities- In Cursor 2.0, they introduced the ability for the A.I. agents to use the browser to help you check for errors or select multiple divs (containers for grouping HTML elements) to reference in the chat. Or you can try to talk your way through it, which can be problematic if you don''t know the proper names of things. The browser eliminates the middleman and reduces the hallucinations and saves tokens for better reasoning and higher performance.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">3. Reasoning models- Cursor gives you plenty of choices when it comes to the model that you want to use for your specific needs. From high speed and low tokens to really smart and thorough. It supports LLMs like gpt-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and more.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Overall, Cursor is definitely high-end software. I would call it the triple-A title of IDEs. At the end of the day, it''s just a tool, but it''s a tool that lets me build things that I couldn''t before. It makes me a faster and better developer and allows me to focus on the things that I''m good at, like thinking about the big picture and the vision of the site.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Wait, I almost missed my favorite feature about Cursor, which is probably the most used feature as well: Compos- Mode. In Compose, you can just type out a general request for a new feature or a fix and Cursor will go and find every file that needs to be updated and suggest the changes for you. This allows you to build out features incredibly fast. When combined with the reasoning of the newest models, it is very powerful.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Code = word zombies.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Cursor mows down lines of code, and it''s only going to get better at doing it. As a vibe-coder, it is my IDE of choice because I can do the vibe coding, but actually connect it to my repository, tools, and services. We will see how far it will take me. I''ve used Figma, Make, Google A.I. Studio, and Co-Pilot, but none of them ever got me this far. Google just dropped Anti-Gravity, which I may give a shot, but right now, I just want to keep building with Cursor until I can roll out my first next key feature for this site.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">If Cursor never changed over 10 years, and it was the only A.I. tool you used every day, then you will probably own 10 multi-million dollar projects. It may run you about $200-500/m depending on what you''re doing, but let''s do the math for an education, shall we?</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">$24,000 for four years. That''s not a bad education. Especially, especially if you''re building to be profitable. And there''s so much opportunity out there to make that $24K back before you graduate. $500 a month is worth setting up a system that can receive money for you over time. And if you convert that into <strong class="font-bold text-white">Bitcoin</strong>? Well, we''ll get into that in the next bit.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">But here''s the thing: In reality, it''s not going to stay the same for 10 years. A.I. will get better, smarter, and cheaper. Vibe coding is to coding, as Serato control records is to vinyl DJs. That last connection between seeing and reading the code to just tapping that sync button and letting the transition ride out is upon us. If you hop in now, you might still remember the old way, which will help you be the best translator for the new way to all the late comers who pick up the shovels after all the digging has been done.</p>' WHERE id = '6c7733dc-ff56-44f4-adf7-5ea75a00aca0';

It includes layouts, buttons, forms, images, text, animations, and other interactive elements. Front-end tools determine how the website looks, how users navigate it, and how they interact with it.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Front-end development uses languages and frameworks like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which instruct the browser on how to display and respond to content.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">For example, on our website:
	•	The marketplace grid showing products is part of the front-end.

UPDATE blog_posts SET content = '<p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Leadership is often described in tidy definitions and laminated cards: loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, personal courage. But no one becomes a leader because they memorized an acronym. Leadership comes from stories - the ones you grow up with, the ones you cling to during the hardest seasons, and the ones you discover about yourself along the way.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Before I ever stood in formation, before deployment orders, before helicopters and sandstorms and long nights of wondering who I would become, there were books. Four stories in particular: <a href="https://amzn.to/49LTmYP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition">The Hobbit</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/4pmALHF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition">Ender’s Game</a>, The <a href="https://amzn.to/4aoEG1W" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition">The Hunger Games</a>, and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I didn’t know it at the time, but these characters - Bilbo, Ender, Katniss, and Edmund - would become mentors, mirrors, and warnings as I navigated my own journey into service, war, and adulthood.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Each book arrived in my life exactly when I needed it. And each character taught me a different face of leadership.</p><div class="mb-6 mx-auto max-w-2xl mt-8"><p class="text-white/60 text-xs italic leading-relaxed text-justify border border-white p-4 bg-white/5">Amazon Affiliate Disclosure: As an Amazon Associate, <strong class="font-bold text-white">PLUTONIUM</strong> earns from qualifying purchases.

There’s a special kind of shock when someone knocks on the door of your comfortable life and tells you your plans are over. That you need to pack your things. That adventure - or violence, or uncertainty - is now mandatory.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Gandalf or Uncle Sam, who really cares? Both show up uninvited. Both tell you, “Let’s go.”</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">What I love about Bilbo is that he is not a warrior. Not a chosen one. Not a knight of the round table. He’s a reluctant fool with every excuse to decline. But the only way out is through. He taught me that courage isn’t the absence of fear or the presence of a sword; it’s the decision to leave the door open even when you’d rather lock it.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">In the military, we talk about “embrace the suck.” Bilbo taught me how to do that with a sense of humor and a steady hand.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Ender Wiggin: Empathy Is the Ultimate Tactical Advantage</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left"><a href="https://amzn.to/4pmALHF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-white/80 transition">Ender’s Game</a> is often read as a book about strategy, but I found it to be a book about the burden of command. Ender is a child forced to grow up in a system that wants his brilliance but doesn’t care about his soul. He’s isolated, manipulated, and pushed to the edge.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">But his greatest strength isn’t his ability to win; it’s his ability to understand. To defeat an enemy, he first has to love them. He has to see the world through their eyes.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">In uniform, it’s easy to dehumanize the mission. It’s easy to see people as data points or objectives. Ender reminded me that a leader who loses their empathy loses their humanity. He taught me that the most powerful thing you can bring to a conflict is the willingness to see the person on the other side of the line.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Katniss Everdeen: Balance Is the Key to Survival</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Katniss Everdeen is a leader born of necessity. She doesn’t want the spotlight. She doesn’t want the responsibility. She just wants to protect the people she loves. She’s a survivor, a huntress, and a symbol of defiance.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">What Katniss taught me is the importance of balance. In the military, you are often pushed to the extreme - physically, mentally, and emotionally. You are expected to be everything to everyone at all times. But Katniss showed me that a leader who doesn’t find balance will eventually break.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">You have to know when to fight and when to rest. When to speak and when to listen. When to lead and when to follow. Katniss taught me that survival is not just about staying alive; it’s about keeping your spirit intact.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-8 text-left first:mt-0">Edmund Pevensie: Redemption Is Always Possible</h2><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Edmund is the traitor. He’s the one who sells out his siblings for a taste of Turkish Delight. He’s the one who falls for the promises of the White Witch. He’s the one who needs to be rescued.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Edmund’s story is a reminder that no one is beyond redemption. We all make mistakes. We all fail. We all have moments where we are tempted by the easy path, by the promises that promise comfort but deliver isolation.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">His betrayal wasn’t stupidity. It was desperation.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">And so was mine.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">But Edmund’s redemption - and mine - only began when he let the façade drop. When he stopped pretending he was fine. When he surrendered the ego of who he thought he was supposed to be.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Within every soldier there’s a lionheart waiting to thaw the winter.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-12 mb-8 text-left first:mt-0">What These Characters Taught Me About Leadership</h2><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Each of these characters carried a different part of the leadership equation - parts the military can teach but can’t fully explain.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Bilbo taught me courage.
Ender taught me empathy.
Katniss taught me balance.
Edmund taught me renewal.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">Together they shaped my understanding of leadership as something more than rank or authority. Leadership is not perfection, certainty, or fearlessness. It’s a journey through discomfort, responsibility, sacrifice, and growth. It’s showing up for others even when you’re barely holding yourself together. It’s learning from stories - especially your own.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">These books didn’t just entertain me.
They prepared me.
They steadied me.
They reminded me who I was in the moments when it mattered most.</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">And in their pages, I learned the truth every leader eventually discovers:</p><p class="mb-6 text-white/90 text-lg leading-relaxed text-left">We become who we are by the adventures we accept, the battles we fight, and the hearts we allow to change us.</p>' WHERE id = '4eab3812-8ba2-4a85-b00e-15f3e75c96bf';
