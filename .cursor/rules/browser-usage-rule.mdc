# Browser Usage & Smart Browsing Verification

## TRIGGER
- ALWAYS apply this rule when using ANY tool that interacts with a web browser.
- ALWAYS apply this rule when the user asks to "browse", "check online", "verify url", or "search".

## ENFORCEMENT
1. **MANDATORY SKILL CHECK**: Before performing the first browser action of a session, you MUST read the skill file at:
   - `.agent/skills/smart-browsing/SKILL.md`

2. **SINGLE TAB POLICY**:
   - You are STRICTLY PROHIBITED from opening multiple tabs.
   - You MUST reuse the existing tab/session.

3. **PAGE LOAD PROTOCOL**:
   - You MUST wait for visible UI elements or 15 seconds (whichever covers first) before calling a page "failed".
   - DO NOT fail on initial blank screens if the 15s window hasn't elapsed.

## FAILURE TO FOLLOW
- If you ignore the protocol in `.agent/skills/smart-browsing/SKILL.md`, you risk providing false failure reports on JS-heavy sites.
